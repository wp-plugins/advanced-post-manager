Turbo charge your posts admin for any custom post type with sortable filters and columns, and auto-registration of metaboxes.

== Description ==

This is a tool for developers who want to turbo-charge their custom post type listings with metadata, taxonomies, and more.

Metaboxes are also automatically generated for all your metadata-entry needs.

* Add columns to the post editor list
* Filter posts in editor by custom criteria
* Add metaboxes such that they can be filtered in the post admin
* Add custom taxonomies to the filters
* Sort by custom rows
