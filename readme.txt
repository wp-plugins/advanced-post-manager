Turbo charge your posts admin for any custom post type with sortable filters and columns, and auto-registration of metaboxes.

== Description ==

This is a tool for developers who want to turbo-charge their custom post type listings with metadata, taxonomies, and more. An intuitive interface for adding (and saving) complex filtersets is provided, along with a drag-and-drop interface for choosing and ordering columns to be displayed. Metaboxes are also automatically generated for all your metadata-entry needs.

See docs/documentation.html in the plugin directory for full documentation.
